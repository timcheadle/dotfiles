# Tim Cheadle's Dotfiles

These are just a simple set of development environment configuration
files I use. Your mileage may vary.

Because they do a better job than I could by myself, these config files
take advantage of the following public projects:

* [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - A super
simple library of zsh config options and aliases
* [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) - A powerful collection of
vim plugins and themes

# Installation

To install, just run the following command:
```
./install
```

It should set up zsh as your default shell, install oh-my-zsh and janus,
and copy the custom configs into their appropriate places.
